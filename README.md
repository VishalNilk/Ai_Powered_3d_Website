# Introduction
Many large corporations already use 3D graphics to showcase their products. I build my own ThreeJS 3D product website and infuse it with the power of artificial intelligence!

In this code I have used the following:

ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations
